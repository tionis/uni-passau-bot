# The Uni Passau Bot
This bot allows you to get this weeks food in the Mensa in the University of Passau.
If you want to try it out there is an already hosted instance at http://t.me/UniPassauBot
but if you want to run it yourself, you can build it yourself, but as I am currently reworking the whole project, it can't run on its own. I will soon add documentation that specifies how to integrate this code with the glyph bot(soon to be released).
